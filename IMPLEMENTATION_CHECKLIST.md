## How to Test

### **Quick Test:**
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Clear all logs
3. Sign up with email/password as ARTIST
4. **Should see exactly these logs (in order):**
   - `✅ NextAuth session loading...` (if applicable)
   - `✅ User already authenticated in Redux, skipping fetch`
   - `📡 Fetching artist profile for user: {id}`
   - NO 401 errors
   - Profile loads successfully

5. Repeat with VENUE role
6. Repeat with Google signup

### **Verify No Issues:**
- ❌ Should NOT see: `401 Unauthorized`
- ❌ Should NOT see: `No token provided`
- ❌ Should NOT see: `🔓 Initial unauthenticated status` (multiple times)
- ❌ Should NOT see: `🔄 Dashboard render count: N` (incrementing rapidly)
